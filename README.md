# MultiDimDVR
Multi-dimensional DVR solver for cartesian coordinates.

It is only used to construct multi-dim DVR Hamiltonian and diagonalization instead of quantum dynamics.

It is based on c++11 standard.

Eigen3 is required, which can be downloaded from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
